This was a group project done to culminate our experience at DevMountain. As a group we decided to clone YouTube.com's basic functionality. The goal was to make an interface in which users could: view, upload, comment, like, and manage video content. We used React for our front-end and Node for the back-end. The database was written in Postgresql and communication was facilitated using Massive. Video's were uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket using Dropzone.js and AWS-SDK. SweetAlert2 and React-Spinners helped enhance the user experience through well designed graphics and animations. User authentication was facilitated by the use of Auth0. HTTP requests were executed using Axios and the the server was written using Express.
